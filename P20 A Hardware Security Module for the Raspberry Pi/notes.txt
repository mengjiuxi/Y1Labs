Supervisor notes for P20
========================

Raspberry Pi SPI
----------------
The Pi is configured as the Master

1. Before the SPI port can be used on the Raspberry Pi, it needs to be enabled:
     sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklsit.conf
	     ... insert a # at the start of the line spi-bcm2708
	 sudo reboot
	     ... confirm all is well with 
	 lsmod
	     ... you should see spi_bcm2708

2. Compile the file spi.cpp using
     g++ -o spi spi.cpp
	     ... all the required files and headers are already in the Qt5 image.
   See: http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/programming-in-c/spi/using-the-spi-interface
		 
3. Run the file
     sudo ./spi
	     ... this rotates one byte of 0xa5 (165) through the SPI port while enabling device 0
		 ... you should see 0 as output as the data is simply lost.
		 
4. Jumper GPIO10 (MOSI) and GPIO9 (MISO) and run again. See the picture DSC01493.JPG
     sudo ./spi
	     ...you should see 165 as output, indicating the data has rotated correctly.
		 
Il Matto SPI
------------
This must be configured as a slave. You'll need to connect the two data lines (as above)
clock (GPIO11) and ground, to the Pi. It's all 3.3V so it should be fine. The slave setup 
is given on the Il Matto Quick Reference: https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/elec1201/IlMattoQR.pdf


RC4
---
RC4 has an exciting history. The original disclosure of the PRNG and key scheduling is here:

There are lots of broken implementations. The students should use the _real_ RC4 PRNG and the real
key scheduling, but are free to use their own technique to mix the session key (received over SPI by
the Il Matto) with the long-term secure secret key (built into the Il Matto code). Just catenating
them is known to be a bad idea (see WEP). But then using RC4 is nowadays also known to be a bad idea.
