In computing, C (pronounced like the letter C) is a general-purpose programming language 
initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs.[4] Its design 
provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it 
found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, most 
notably system software like the Unix computer operating system.

C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, and there are 
very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist.

Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including: C#, D, Go, 
Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, Perl, PHP, Python, and Unix's C Shell. The most pervasive 
influence on these languages has been syntactical, and they tend to combine the 
recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems and data 
models that can be radically different. C++ started as a preprocessor for C and is 
currently nearly a superset of C.

Before there was an official standard for C, many users and implementors relied on an 
informal specification contained in a book by Ritchie and Brian Kernighan; that version is 
generally referred to as "K&R" C. In 1989 the American National Standards Institute 
published a standard for C (generally called "ANSI C" or "C89"). The next year, the same 
specification was approved by the International Organization for Standardization as an 
international standard (generally called "C90"). ISO later released an extension to the 
internationalization support of the standard in 1995, and a revised standard (known as 
"C99") in 1999. The current version of the standard (now known as "C11") was approved in 
December of 2011. Adapted from Wikipedia C_(programming_language)
