2. Preparation
1. What does the acronym UART stand for?
Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter
2. What baud rates are supported by the UART for serial communication?
300 600 1200 1800 2400 4800 7200 9600 14400 19200 38400 57600 115200 230400 460800 921600
Usually used: 9600 to 115200
12MHz crystal support: below(include) 19200
3. When an 8-bit ASCII character is transmitted over the UART howmany bits are sent, and what does each one represent?
Minimum: 1(Start) + 8(Data) + 1(Stop)
Maximum: 1(Start) + 8(Data) + 1(Parity) + 2(Stop)
4. How many devices can be connected to the UART simultaneously?
2, a master and a slave
5. What does the acronym SPI stand for?
Serial Peripheral Interface
6. What clock rates are supported by the SPI for serial communication?
(Up to 100 MHz) 100 Mbit/s 12.5 MB/s <wikipeida.org>
7. When an 8-bit ASCII character is transmitted over the SPI how many bits are sent, and what does each one represent?
8(Data) + 1(Acknowledge)
8. How many devices can be connected to the SPI simultaneously?
In theory, infinity
9. What does the acronym I2C stand for?
10. What clock rates are supported by the I2C for serial communication?
11. When an 8-bit ASCII character is transmitted over the I2C how many bits are sent, and what does each one represent?
12. How many devices can be connected to the I2C simultaneously?
